# Library-Services

## Description

A micro-project to experiment with writing microservices in a containerized
Node-MongoDB environment. 
The docker settings are working well but are still a work in progress and can be
improved on.

It is based on a video series found on Youtube, but with improvements.

# Challenges and extra features

*   Made without node installed on the host.
*   Improved file and services structure.
*   Containerized services that are able to call each other.
